            Are you having flashbacks to your third grade English class? 
            Are you remembering your teacher telling you that a paragraph 
            includes five sentences: a topic sentence, three developing 
            sentences and a concluding sentence? That’s academic writing. 
            This is marketing writing. Your audience members are never going 
            to read those 200-word sentences.

            I know, I know. Your third grade teacher taught you that 
            paragraphs were one unit of thought. They are. Just as your 
            entire piece covers one idea, your sentences are units of 
            thought, your words each express a single idea — heck, 
            even the syllables each convey a concept.
